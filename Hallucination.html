            <h1 class="title">HALLUCINATION</h1>
            <p>Hallucination is what I consider to be my true first album (no disrespect to Depths of the Cave or Nerrolad). It has a couple official releases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>5-Track Release (original Spotify release)</li>
                <li>8-Track Release (original Bandcamp release. Lost media)</li>
                <li>10-Track Release (original BandLab release)</li>
                <li>11-Track Release (modern release. All tracks + enchanced audio quality)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This page will primarily be talking about the 11-Track Release. I'm still not entirely sure how there ended up being so many different tracklists. I assume I just kept on forgetting to add track after track until I finally got my act together with the 11-Track release.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>This album, alongside ERROLAD GASSEN, have gotten me into the most drama</li>
                <li>Hallucination was made in 2.5 days after Blast to the Past! after I found Bandcamp and my brain went into turbo mode</li>
                <li>The Dream Monster from A Normal Album was meant to be on Hallucination but I never got around to making it until A Normal Album</li>
