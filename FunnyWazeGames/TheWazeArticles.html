                <hr><h1>5/24/2025 - GMO Super-Food Potatoes Invented by Homeless People May Solve World Hunger, Experts Say</h1>
                <p>A group of homeless people who call themselves the "potato people" have achieved their mission of creating a potato that are so efficient and make crops in such abundancy per plant (20-80 potatoes) that they could easily feed entire villages with just a small farm. How did they achieve such a super-crop, you may ask? They still won't explain, but whatever...</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, there isn't much more to it, so this article probably wont be able to meet our criteria for "sufficiently long article", but we still consider this extremely news-worthy! The mayor is still talking with the US government to try and get this super-potato out. We know this will be worth it!</p>

                <p>Joeth Gastrist was just a regular guy on his toilet. At least that was until guests he had over at the time recall hearing something animalistic coming from the bathroom followed by blood curling screams and Joeth never coming out.</p>
                <p>And, how did this happen? Well, <span id="redacted" title="Highlightsons may or may not be alive, and we've witnessed the first recorded casualty." aria-hidden="true">[REDACTED]</span></p>
