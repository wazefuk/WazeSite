            <h1 class="title">WazeSite!</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the official website for Wazefuk, created and designed by yours truly! Here, you can <span class="emph">CLICK LINKS</span> and <span class="emph">READ</span>! Who could ask for more!?</p>
            <!-- Fun fact for source code snoopers: the "emph" span elements were originally strong elements but I swapped the strongs out for these because... uh... well, the reason's not important! -->
            <div class="monologue">
                <p>Well, I don't want to keep you waiting, but, what's the fun in instantly getting what you want? Sure, you could just skip this little monologue, but the fear of missing out on some important details may persuade you into doing otherwise.</p>
                <p>Hi, I'm Wazefuk, and I make music, small novels of which most never get finished, among others. The best way I feel I could be described is <span id="Waze_ml_desc" style="opacity: 80%;">"avant-garde, surreal, experimental, and <i>weird</i>"</span>, and that's <i>very</i> accurate! Well, enough with the useless essay that explains nothing and is probably just filler, on to what you're here for!</p>

        <nav class="links">
            <hr><h2>LINKS</h2>  <!-- <hr> doesn't work unless it's inside the div and directly before the header for some reason. Probably something to do with my dumb and clunky CSS but I don't feel like rewriting the entire code for my funny bars -->
            <p>I do stuff! What a surprise!<br>Well, I don't want this home page to be bloated, I'd rather it be not too big, so I'd give every type of thing I've made <i>(books, music, whatever)</i> it's own respective page.</p>
            
            <h3><a href="Music.html">MUSIC</a></h3><p>Everything from a 7 year old's MIDIs of randomly placed notes, to real songs, to albums.</p>
            
            <h3><a href="Books.html">BOOKS</a></h3><p>AKA the ones I finish the least. WARNING: may of these are old as hell and probably very cringe!</p>
            
            <h3><a href="Games.html">GAMES</a></h3><p>Playable pictures!!!!</p>
