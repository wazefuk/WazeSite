        <h1>001 - Sticky</h1>
        <p>Sticky is a very... interesting character. They've never had a very defined... anything? It's like they've existed alongside, maybe even before Wazefuk was a character, but they've just... never been fleshed out? Strange. I guess there's no better time to actually define them then in an encyclopedia of which they're the second entry!</p>
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Sticky, as you could've guessed by the name, is a stick figure. A tall line for a torso, two arms with two lines for each that connect to form an elbow, same for the legs with two lines for each leg that connect to form a knee. They have two smaller lines to represent feet. They have no hands (but can still hold, grab, whatever you could do with hands). Their head is simply a circle on the top of their torso with a face identical to Wazefuk's.</p>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>Sticky is a very laid-back person. They only really take much seriously when there's actual stakes at hand (e.g. the TV's broken), otherwise just exists pleasantly. They're like that one NPC in a video game that just leans against a table or wall while smiling smugly and shares occasional witty one-liners with the player.</p>
        <p>When Sticky does on occasion snap out of their daydream mode, they're quite a cool person, using their somehow obtained college-level expertise in every concievable subject to get Wazefuk and the Gang out of whatever conundrum is at hand.</p>
