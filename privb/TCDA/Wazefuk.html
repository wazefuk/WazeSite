        <p>For Jack: TO DO: Make the personality more descriptive, add more extras, figure out why the character ID is in hexadecimal instead of normal decimal</p>
        <h1>000 - Wazefuk</h1>
        <p>Wazefuk is a very interesting character. Not only is he, by far, the longest-lasting character surviving since I was 9 (not without many, many changes), but he has also the longest-surviving character in terms of staying relatively the same (relatively, again). (note: if you're gonna read this front-to-back, enjoy the detailed descriptions because oh boy does my memory get foggy later on)</p>
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Wazefuk's appearance is very simple. They look like a generic white figure with the same texture as a vinyl figurine, with cylindrical arms/legs, ball hands, hemisphere feet, rounded rectangle torso, and a ball head without a neck; and is floating just above their shoulders. They're face is just a line for a mouth and another two lines for their eyes. They also occasionally have a little stroke in their crotch, although usage has become archaic and discouraged (as for why, I don't know). It's also nice how their body also works very well in both 2D and 3D styles, and they're not confined to either dimension.</p>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>Wazefuk's personality changes drastically on occasion, but can generally be split into two: grounded and comedic.</p>
        <p>Grounded Wazefuk is a lot like a protagonist from an action movie during a solemn and serious part. He's just completely locked in into whatever he's doing at any given time, and shows little to no emotion other than coldness. That's really all I can muster about grounded Wazefuk because it's really just so inexplicably calculated and as if he's the reincarnation of Jesus Christ who came down in the heavens to complete a task and only that.</p>
        <p>Comedic Wazefuk is the polar opposite of grounded Wazefuk. It's as if he's straight from a Sr Pelo skit, jumping off the walls and being extremely loud and obnoxious. He never takes anything serious, and just cracks a few bubbly jokes. He has so much energy that, no, stimming isn't enough; he needs to eject his nervous system and dance with it.</p>
        <h2>Godhood Lore</h2>
        <p>Also, there is something very important you should know about Wazefuk... He is actually a near omnipotent entity. He is at least in the top 50 most powerful beings in fiction history. He was created into his world, Disitus, with the sole purpose of ruling it with his godhood. Note that he could've sworn he had a life *loonnngg* before being sent to Disitus, as if some divine intervention sent him here against his will, but he can't quite remember what he did/was before Disitus....</p>
        <p>God Wazefuk is what happens when Wazefuk channels a considerable portion of their total power. They become 16x the size, they become all black, their face becomes glowing white with a slight colorful static overlaying their eyes, and parts of limbs may randomly dissapear (like their left leg from the knee down) and only come back when they return to normal Wazefuk.</p>
        <p>Also, Wazefuk finds using more than 0.0065% of their power (enough to level continents) to be rather agonizing, which is why they only use their power for the greater good (i.e. pranking their friends, stopping terrorism, abolishing demons, supporting charity with materialized wealth)</p>
        <p>One planck time of 100% power would erase this universe, every other universe, all 848249 multiverses, scrub the very concept of existence, rewind the big bang, wipe all possible timelines that could happen; have happened; or will happen, and then some.</p>
        <p>People who have seen 60+% power Wazefuk's form report just seeing blinding flashes of color and patterns beyond mortal and immortal comprehension that it's a downright cognitohazard. Everyone who has seen as much as 5% Wazefuk needed life-long therapy from even thinking about what divinity they tried to percieve.</p>
        <h2>Extras</h2>
        <p>1 - Wazefuk, Sticky, Brondy, and Tilli are all friends and are canonically the "main characters" of Disitus (if it were like a video game or TV show)</p>
        <p>2 - Wazefuk is approximately 19,700 years old and with the mental age of ~26</p>
        <p>3 - Grounded Wazefuk was a rather recent moment of character development (those 19,698 years of comedic Wazefuk were absolute pain)</p>
        <p>4 - Wazefuk's favorite food is apple pie</p>
        <p>5 - No, Karen, Jesus does NOT overpower Wazefuk. Nowhere close, in fact. Wazefuk has more power in a single molecule, stupid.</p>
        <p>6 - Despite his apparent godhood, most people just treat him like an obscure relative of sorts.</p>
