                <p>Welcome to The Character Doc Archive! This is a collection of descriptions of pretty much every character I've ever made <span title="(e.g. characters owned by Elitebigbans902 that were lost to the great deletion and I took partial ownersip of)">(that haven't been lost to the sands of time, that is)</span> and can recall to any degree.</p>
                <p>Without further ado, roll the characters!</p>
